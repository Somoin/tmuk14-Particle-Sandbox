# Particle Sandbox
A particle simulator using the concept of Cellular Automaton. <br/>
The program is a desktop GUI where you can select different materials / elements that you can place on the screen with the mouse, each with different behaviors. <br/>

Basic Examples: 
- Sand particles that fall and clump up
- Water particles that flow
- Concrete particles that are static

# Implementation
The language used is Python using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library. 

# How to run
Ensure Pygame is installed and run main.py from inside the src directory.

# Testing
To run the unit test you need to install [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html). <br/>
When inside the src directory write: python -m pytest unit_test.py
